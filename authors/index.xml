      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a Brazilian geographer looking foward to adress environmental challenges with geographical data science, taking the power of earth observation data, spatial statistics and software development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did I get here?
While working with the assessment of the brazilian&amp;rsquo;s flora conservation status, I realized that, by that time, there was a lot to do and a few human resources. So, I decided to do a specialization in spatial statistics looking foward for tools that could help the assessment optimization. I ended with a statisticl approach to estimated the exposure of floras&#39; species over fire, one of the most known proxy of environmental degradation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my master project I have worked with spatial priorization to make conservation and mineral exploration compatible on an Environmental Reserve in the Amazon forest (link to brief summary?).&lt;/p&gt;
